I'm looking for new features to add! If you think of any send them to me at

  One week until I head off for a journey across Europe. This will mean that
  no bugfixes or other enhancements will be made to devtodo for approximately
  three or four months.

  Many, many new features and fixes in 0.1.4. I'm also simultaneously working
  on the next major revision which will allow databases to be linked together,
  allow for much more useful filtering and reporting, etc. Basically, a major
  overhaul.

  Minor disaster where I tried --no-sync and it promptly removed my entire
  database for todo! I rebuilt it, sort of, from TODO. Ironic really.

  I've started compiling todo on the sourceforge compile farm, so it's now
  been successfully compiled on Debian, Slackware, Solaris 2.8 and FreeBSD.

  I'd also like to give a heartfelt thanks to the guys at Sourceforge and
  VA Linux for contributing such a valuable resource to the community.
