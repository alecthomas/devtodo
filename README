Todo is a program to display and manage a hierarchical list of outstanding work,
or just reminders.

The program itself is assisted by a few shell scripts that override default
builtins. Specifically, cd, pushd and popd are overridden so that when using
one of these commands to enter a directory, the todo will display any 
outstanding items in that directory. These scripts are available in the doc
sub-directory as scripts.sh and scripts.tcsh.

For much more complete information please refer to the man page (devtodo(1)).

Some examples of sneaky ways to use devtodo:

1. Displaying only one item:
	todo 12

2. Displaying *all* items:
	todo all

3. Removing items 1 through 10:
	tdr 1-10

4. Making item 10.1 a child of item 13:
	todo -R 10.1,13

5. Using the binary database loader (but falling back to XML):
	echo "database-loaders binary,xml" >> ~/.todorc

6. *NOT* using the binary database loader at all, ever:
	echo "database-loaders xml" >> ~/.todorc

7. Generating a simplistic TODO file:
	todo --TODO --format generated='%2>%i- %+1T' all

8. Being verbose:
	todo -v

9. Being very verbose:
	todo -vv

10. Display only medium priority items that are completed and have the word
  "foobar" in them:
	todo all done /foobar

10. man devtodo
	man devtodo
